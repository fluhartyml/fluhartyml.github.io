                    <p>After retiring from computer electronics repair, I found a new passion in app development. Not out of necessity, but out of curiosity and the joy of creation. Every app I build solves a problem I've personally encountered or addresses a need I've identified.</p>
                    <p>This approach keeps development fun and meaningful. I'm not chasing trends or building for the masses—I'm creating tools that I actually use, and if others find them useful too, that's a bonus.</p>

                    <p>NightGard is my answer to the complexity of modern web hosting. It's a suite of macOS tools designed to make self-hosting simple and accessible. The core wWw NGPortal application recently achieved MVP status—a fully functional local web server with DDNS integration.</p>
                    <p>The goal is to give individual developers and hobbyists the power to host their own content without relying on third-party services. Privacy, control, and simplicity are the driving principles.</p>

                    <p>My journey into software development started with hardware. Years of diagnosing and fixing electronics gave me a unique perspective on how systems work—both physical and digital.</p>
                    <p>Transitioning from fixing machines to building software felt natural. The same problem-solving mindset applies, just at a different layer of abstraction. And honestly, debugging code is a lot cleaner than soldering circuit boards.</p>

                    <p>Swift and SwiftUI have made app development more accessible than ever. Apple's development tools are powerful, well-documented, and—most importantly—they just work.</p>
                    <p>I've been an Apple Developer since 2009, watching the ecosystem evolve. The consistency across iOS, macOS, tvOS, and visionOS means I can build once and deploy everywhere. That's powerful for a solo developer.</p>
