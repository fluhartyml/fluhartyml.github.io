            <div class="post-content">
                <p>After retiring from computer electronics repair, I found a new passion in app development. Not out of necessity, but out of curiosity and the joy of creation. Every app I build solves a problem I've personally encountered or addresses a need I've identified.</p>

                <p>This approach keeps development fun and meaningful. I'm not chasing trends or building for the masses—I'm creating tools that I actually use, and if others find them useful too, that's a bonus.</p>

                <h2>The Freedom of Retirement Development</h2>

                <p>Retirement gave me something invaluable: time without pressure. I'm not racing to meet deadlines, impress investors, or chase unicorn valuations. I build what interests me, when it interests me.</p>

                <p>This freedom has made me a better developer. Without the pressure to ship fast and iterate faster, I can focus on quality, thoughtful design, and actually solving problems properly.</p>

                <h2>Solving My Own Problems</h2>

                <p>The best software comes from scratching your own itch. Every app in my portfolio started with a simple thought: "I wish I had a tool that could do this."</p>

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>TakeAChanceOnMe</strong> - I needed a simple random number generator across all my devices</li>
                    <li><strong>Tally Matrix Clock</strong> - I wanted a unique visual clock for my Apple TV</li>
                    <li><strong>wWw NGPortal</strong> - I wanted to self-host without the complexity of traditional server setups</li>
                </ul>

                <p>Each project is personal. Each one solves a real problem I've experienced.</p>

                <h2>The Joy of Creation</h2>

                <p>There's something deeply satisfying about building things. Taking an idea from concept to reality, seeing it work, and then actually using it in your daily life—that's the reward.</p>

                <p>Money and downloads are nice, but they're not why I do this. I build because I can, because it's fun, and because creating things brings me joy.</p>

                <h2>Advice for Others</h2>

                <p>If you're thinking about starting your own development journey, my advice is simple: build what you need. Don't worry about market size or monetization strategies. Just solve a problem you have, make it work well, and share it.</p>

                <p>The rest will follow naturally.</p>
