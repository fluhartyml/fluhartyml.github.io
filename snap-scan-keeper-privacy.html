        <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
        <p class="last-updated">Effective Date: November 24, 2025</p>

        <div class="highlight">
            <strong>Privacy Summary:</strong> Snap & Scan Keeper does not collect, store, or transmit any of your data. Everything stays on your device.
        </div>

        <h2>Introduction</h2>
        <p>Snap & Scan Keeper ("the App") is developed by Michael Lee Fluharty ("we," "us," or "our"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how the App handles your information.</p>

        <h2>Information Collection and Use</h2>
        <h3>We Do Not Collect Any Data</h3>
        <p>Snap & Scan Keeper does not collect, store, or transmit any personal information, usage data, or analytics. The App operates entirely on your device and does not communicate with any external servers.</p>

        <h3>Document Processing</h3>
        <p>All document scanning and processing occurs locally on your device using iOS VisionKit framework. Your scanned documents:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Never leave your device</li>
            <li>Are not uploaded to any servers</li>
            <li>Are not analyzed or processed by us</li>
            <li>Are only saved to locations you explicitly choose (Photos app or shared via iOS share sheet)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Permissions</h2>
        <p>The App requests the following permissions to function:</p>

        <h3>Camera Access</h3>
        <p>Required to scan documents using your device camera. Camera access is only used when you actively scan a document. No photos or videos are captured outside of the scanning process.</p>

        <h3>Photos Access</h3>
        <p>Optional. Only requested if you choose a save mode that writes to Photos (PDF Only, Both, or Pages Only). Photos access allows the App to save scanned documents to custom albums in your Photos library. You can use the App without granting Photos access by using "Share Only" mode.</p>

        <h2>Data Storage</h2>
        <p>If you choose to save scans to Photos:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Scans are stored in your device's Photos library</li>
            <li>PDFs are saved to "Snap&ScanKeeper PDFs" album</li>
            <li>Individual images are saved to "Snap&ScanKeeper Images" album</li>
            <li>You have full control over these files through the iOS Photos app</li>
            <li>Data is subject to your iCloud Photos settings (if enabled)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>Snap & Scan Keeper does not use any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services. The App does not integrate with any external services or APIs.</p>

        <h2>Children's Privacy</h2>
        <p>The App does not collect any information from anyone, including children under 13. The App is suitable for all ages.</p>

        <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
        <p>We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be posted on this page with an updated effective date. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated Privacy Policy.</p>

        <h2>Your Rights</h2>
        <p>Since we do not collect any data:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>There is no data to access, modify, or delete from our servers</li>
            <li>All your scanned documents are stored locally on your device or in your Photos library</li>
            <li>You can delete the App at any time to remove all App-related data from your device</li>
            <li>Photos saved to your library can be managed through the iOS Photos app</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Security</h2>
        <p>Your documents never leave your device unless you explicitly share them using the iOS share sheet. All processing occurs locally using Apple's secure VisionKit framework.</p>
